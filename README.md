# Convolutional Neural Networks: Application 🧠

## Overview 📚
This repository demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow for image classification. It focuses on the implementation of a CNN architecture for recognizing different signs. The model includes various layers like convolutional, ReLU activation, max pooling, flattening, and a fully connected output layer. 

## Objective 🎯
The goal is to build and train a CNN to classify images in a dataset using TensorFlow. The process includes the following steps:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded and normalized for training.
2. **CNN Architecture**: A simple CNN architecture is used, including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and a fully connected layer.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on the dataset and evaluated on its performance.

## Key Components ⚙️

### 1. **Loading the Dataset** 🔄
The dataset is loaded, and an example image is displayed along with its label.

```python
# Load the dataset
X_train_orig, Y_train_orig, X_test_orig, Y_test_orig, classes = load_dataset()

# Display an example image
index = 6
plt.imshow(X_train_orig[index])
plt.title(f"Label: {np.squeeze(Y_train_orig[:, index])}")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

### 2. **Parameter Initialization** 🎲
The weight parameters for the convolutional layers are initialized using Xavier initialization.

```python
def initialize_parameters():
    # Initialize convolutional weights
    W1 = tf.Variable(initializer(shape=(4, 4, 3, 8)), name="W1")
    W2 = tf.Variable(initializer(shape=(2, 2, 8, 16)), name="W2")
    parameters = {"W1": W1, "W2": W2}
    return parameters
```

### 3. **Forward Propagation** 🔁
The CNN architecture is defined in the forward propagation step, where convolutional, ReLU, max-pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers are applied.

```python
def forward_propagation(X, parameters):
    # Apply convolution, ReLU, max-pooling, and fully connected layers
    ...
    return Z3
```

### 4. **Cost Function** 💸
The cost function is computed using softmax cross-entropy loss to optimize the model during training.

```python
def compute_cost(Z3, Y):
    cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=Z3, labels=Y))
    return cost
```

### 5. **Model Training** 🔥
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The training and validation loss are plotted to monitor progress.

```python
def model(X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test, learning_rate=0.009, num_epochs=100):
    # Define CNN architecture and compile the model
    ...
    return train_accuracy, test_accuracy, parameters
```
