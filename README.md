# Convolutional Neural Networks: Application üß†

## Overview üìö
This repository demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow for image classification. It focuses on the implementation of a CNN architecture for recognizing different signs. The model includes various layers like convolutional, ReLU activation, max pooling, flattening, and a fully connected output layer.
